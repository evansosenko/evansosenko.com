## Generating Hanle fits

This is the recommended procedure for creating your own Hanle fits
using [evansosenko/spin-lifetime-analysis][spin-lifetime-analysis].

1. Obtain a copy of the code.
  - Fork or clone the [git repository][spin-lifetime-analysis] on GitHub.
  - Alternatively, if you are uncomfortable with version control,
    you can download a compressed archive of the code.
1. Add you own data under a subfolder in `data`.
   - Remove any existing data you will not be using,
     or do not have permission to use.
   - Modify `analysis/data.py`.
     This should contain classes that define how to import your data.
     See [scipy_data_fitting.Data][scipy-data_fitting:docs:data].
1. Define new models or modify existing models in `analysis/models.py`.
   - See [scipy_data_fitting.Model][scipy-data_fitting:docs:model].
1. Define new fits or modify existing fits in `analysis/fits.py`.
   - See [scipy_data_fitting.Fit][scipy-data_fitting:docs:fit].
1. Use `analysis/analysis.py` to control what fits to run and how to save the results.
1. Follow the instructions in the [README][spin-lifetime-analysis] on how to run and view the fits.

For details on how to use `scipy-data_fitting`, refer to the
[README][scipy-data_fitting] and [core documentation][scipy-data_fitting:docs].
